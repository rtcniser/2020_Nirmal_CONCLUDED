RTC's Hands-free Sanitizer
Developed by Integrated Masters students of NISER in our lab. Along with being handsfree, it is smart enough to let the user know via email when the sanitiser drops below a certain limit, so it can be refilled before it is empty. The prototypes were made using the 3D printers.
This is currently distributed across certain locations in NISER where you can definately see its usage.
